RATA is a desktop application made with the Python language and Tkinter library which simulates and facilitates 
the gameplay of the Fire Emblem Heroes (2017) mobile game. Fire Emblem Heroes (FEH) is a strategy game developed
by Nintendo/Intelligent Systems featuring a cast of characters from the Fire Emblem series.

Users are given free access to the game's playable units and skills to experiment with. In the future, as the 
game's AI is further studied, more testing tools will be provided for more thorough testing of optimal layouts.
This project is also being made to preserve FEH's gameplay since it is a live service application with an eventual
sunset, but that date is still far off.
